    <h1>CRYPTO CURRENCY</h1>
    <img src="./static/cryptocurrency.jpg" alt="CRYPTO CURRENCY">
    <h2>Cryptocurrency allows for the exchange of digital units (currency) that are non-governmental and are secured by cryptography (Investopedia, 2018). It is that last feature of its definition that has the name cryptocurrency. The majority of the world's currency is issued as exchangeable units by governments, and its value is regulated by them. The strongest currencies are those that allow their currency to float freely on the market. This is because the value is determined in part by supply and demand, and is backed by that nation's ability to raise revenues. Currency values are fixed in other nations. These official values may or may not represent the ability of the state to raise funds, but the value is nonetheless enforceable by law.
        Cryptocurrencies differ from other currencies in that their value is derived from their supply and demand alone. The demand for cryptocurrencies is driven both by consumer trust in the currency as a medium of exchange. In addition to this, there is a demand for a currency that is not governed by governments.Among cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is one of the most well-known. A key feature of Bitcoin that has helped it rise to prominence is the concept of the blockchain. Bitcoin works when the Bitcoin client software generates unique mathematically linked keys, one private and one public. In the case of Bitcoin, the client will verify the transaction by sending it to all other users online. The transaction will then be logged by Bitcoin miners who race to solve a cryptographic puzzle. In theory, this guarantees the transaction's security and trustworthiness.</h2>
