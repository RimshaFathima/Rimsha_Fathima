    <h1>END OF AN ERA START OF DIGITILITY</h1>
    <h2>Once there lived a girl named Caroline from the village of Operose. Caroline was studying in 10th grade she was a diligent girl and teachers often praised her for her academic excellence but unfortunately, her parents were not impressed by her and this made her depressed. Due to the covid crisis in their village, the schools were forced to shut down and E-learning was substituted. But no one anticipated that Caroline would encounter a significant obstacle to her education? Well, Caroline did face this obstacle. Caroline's parents needed to buy devices for their children as E-learning came into effect. They still could afford to buy two devices for their children, despite its heavy price. They didn't buy Caroline a device despite having enough money; instead, they focused all their attention on their younger son Chester and provided for his needs. She approached her parents with the request of obtaining the E-Learning essentials, however, their response was no, saying Chester is a boy and knows how to use the high-tech devices and you will not, and in addition, studying will not benefit you. Educating you would be pointless Caroline nearly broke down, but managed to keep her composure. Though she was often taunted by her parents, their actions only inspired her to prove that woman are capable of anything if given the right assistance. Her goal was to provide equal access to education for women and men from all corners of the globe. It became apparent to Caroline that not only she but many of her village's girls were being denied education by their parents. She felt it must change. The next day, she started to save money by selling valuable items that belonged to Caroline and her friend gave her a good sum of money for her plan. Soon Caroline had a good amount of money Caroline opened a campaign named #EducateGirlsAndEmpowerThem! for girl children's who were denied education and provided around 120 children with devices alongside Caroline studied further. Soon she became a social activist and, in her village, Operose no girl child was left uneducated. Caroline bought a tremendous change in her country Archenland every woman was as equal as a Man and women were in fact better than men. Caroline collaborated with people from around the world. Caroline did not stop there she opened a school that took online classes for children for free from around the world for all they had to do was contact Caroline. The digital school was her new school and within a few weeks she had children from all over the world joining her classes; Caroline soon became a big name around the World. Archenlands honoured her with its "Influential Women" award. She received several awards for her work by many countries. In the end, Caroline's parents saw the changes Caroline brought and understood that a woman could do the same as a man. Now her parents supported her But Caroline did not stop there. Providing students with digital education continued to be her focus. Her dream was turned into reality. </h2>
